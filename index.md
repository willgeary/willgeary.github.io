Hello, my name is Will. I'm a data scientist and the head of data visualization at [CitySwifter](https://cityswifter.com/). CitySwifter is a business intelligence platform for urban bus networks, using deep learning and optimization to help transport operators better match supply with forecasted passenger demand. Prior to joining CitySwifter, I consulted on geospatial data science at the United Nations and worked as a researcher on the mobility team at [Mapzen](https://www.mapzen.com). I recently completed my M.S. in Data Science from Columbia Unversity's School of Engineering and previously received a B.S. in Economics and B.A. in Philosophy from Duke University.

I'm passionate about sustainable transportation and open source software. I developed and maintain [TransitFlow](https://github.com/transitland/transitland-processing-animation), a free and open-source software tool for visualizing scheduled urban and regional transit frequency around the world! Here's a [blog post](https://mapzen.com/blog/animating-transitland/) with more info.
