This animation shows the flow of Amtrak trains across America over one week (Monday through Sunday). 

I used Python to pull together the data and [Processing](https://processing.org/) to create the animation. Amtrak's GTFS Data obtained via a FOIA request, see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/transit-developers/XcSiFD3uzuw).

You can find my Python notebook and processing code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/willgeary/AmericaByTrain).
