Forget everything you think you know about New Jersey. This state has some beautiful country for cycling. I had plans to visit friends on the beach in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, south of Atlantic City. This is only 150 miles from New York, so I decided to bike there.

### Day 1: New York  to Egg Harbor, NJ (120 miles)

I'm just as much of a Jersey-snob as the next person. So I was surprised with how beautiful this ride was.

I started off the trip taking a ferry from Lower Manhattan to Sandy Hook, NJ.

I found a bike trail that was mostly dirt.

I realized that I should have brought thicker tires.

Nice smooth roads approaching Egg Harbor.

Rode through a cute little town with a humble hot dog stand serving as its primary town center.

Arriving in Egg Harbor just before sunset.

Highlight of the trip: the new 9th Street Bridge in Ocean City, NJ. Feels like a roller coaster.
