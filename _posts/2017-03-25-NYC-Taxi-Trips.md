A random day's worth of green and yellow taxi trips in New York City.

Data from: www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml

The trip data was loaded into a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension using this very helpful guide: https://github.com/toddwschneider/nyc-taxi-data

The visualization was created with Processing.
