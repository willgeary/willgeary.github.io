Hello, my name is Will. I'm currently consulting on geospatial data science at the United Nations and pursuing an [M.S. in Data Science](http://datascience.columbia.edu/master-of-science-in-data-science) at Columbia University, studying machine learning, data visualization and geospatial analytics. 

While interning on the mobility team at [Mapzen](https://www.mapzen.com) this summer I developed [TransitFlow](https://github.com/transitland/transitland-processing-animation), free and open-source software tool for visualizing regional transit network frequency from the command line! Thanks to the amazing people at Mapzen for the opportunity to work on it. Here's a [blog post](https://mapzen.com/blog/animating-transitland/) with more info.
