(Male = blue dots, female = pink dots. Forgive me for the heteronormative colorscheme)

This visualization was created using Processing, Python and Citbike [trip data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). Many thanks to Juan Francisco for creating [this tutorial](https://github.com/juanfrans-courses/DataScienceSocietyWorkshop) on visualizing data with Processing.
