Hello, my name is Will. I'm a data scientist interested in space-time modeling and visualization. I enjoy combining deep learning, GIS and creative coding to produce novel and compelling products and insights. I recently completed an M.S. in Data Science from Columbia University, and previously received a B.S in Economics and B.A. in Philosophy from Duke University.

I'm currently employed as a data scientist and the head of data visualization at [CitySwifter](https://cityswifter.com/). CitySwifter is a business intelligence platform for urban bus networks, using deep learning and optimization to help transport operators better match supply with forecasted passenger demand.

I'm passionate about sustainable transportation and open source software. I developed and maintain [TransitFlow](https://github.com/transitland/transitland-processing-animation), a free and open-source software tool for visualizing scheduled urban and regional transit frequency around the world! Here's a [blog post](https://mapzen.com/blog/animating-transitland/) with more info.
