This blog was created using Jekyll and Github Pages. You can view the source code as a Github repository [here](https://github.com/willgeary/willgeary.github.io).

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

Posts exist in the `_posts` directory. You can go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  return "Hi, #{name}"
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
