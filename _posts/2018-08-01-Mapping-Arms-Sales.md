U.S. and USSR/Russian arms sales from 1950 through 2017. [Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's Arms Transfers Database](https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers). Units are expressed in trend indicator values (TIV). Each dot on the map = one TIV. Visualization by Will Geary (@wgeary).

For more information about trend indicator values, methodology or weapons coverage, see [here](https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers/sources-and-methods).
