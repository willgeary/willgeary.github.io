### Day 1: Brooklyn to Orient Point, NY (110 miles)

Starting from Brooklyn, I rode through sprawling Long Island all the way to Orient Point, the very tip of the north fork of long island, which is quiet and beautiful. Stealth camped on the beach in Orient Beach State Park. Fell asleep to a violently purple sky and the sounds of waves gently lapping at the shore.

### Day 2: Orient Point to Providence, RI (76 miles)

Woke up and caught the Cross Sound Ferry from Orient Point to New London, CT. Finished off the rest of the day through Connecticut and Rhode Island, with an obligatory rest stop at Dunkin' Donuts. Arrived in Providence, RI before sundown.

Below is the full trip. I used Google maps biking directions. They worked pretty well. I may have gotten lost in the woods once in Connecticut, but that's part of the experience.

**What I Would Change:** The first 50 miles or so of Day 1 through Long Island are pretty ugly, unless you love highway strip mall shops (which I kind of do). In the future, I would bring my bike on the Long Island Rail Road all the way out to Bridgehampton or even Montauk and then bike / ferry your way from Sag Harbor to Shelter Island to Orient Point. Look up Shelter Island on Google maps and you'll see what I'm talking about. There are few cute little ferries that go back and forth every 10 minutes or so. I did this on the way back, and it was magical. Prettier than biking through sprawling Long Island.
